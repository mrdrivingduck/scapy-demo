Scripts of how to use _Python_ module _[Scapy](https://scapy.net/)_

_Scapy_ version: __2.4.0__

This module is of great importance for both engineering & academic experiments.

Maybe we can integrate this module as a _WEB_ server to be a part of _IDS_.

Or writing some scripts for a simple experiment.
